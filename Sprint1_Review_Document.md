# Sprint 1 Review: Biomechanical Neural Network Analysis of the Straight Drive in Cricket

## Project Overview

The Biomechanical Neural Network Analysis system aims to revolutionize cricket coaching by using pose estimation and deep learning to evaluate the straight drive technique. This system captures a player's joint positions, extracts kinematic features, classifies technique using neural networks, and provides actionable feedback to athletes and coaches.

## Sprint 1 Accomplishments

During Sprint 1, we successfully established the foundational architecture and implemented the core modules of the cricket biomechanics analysis system. The focus was on creating a robust, modular structure that will support future development iterations.

### 1. Project Structure and Organization

We established a comprehensive project structure following best practices for Python projects:

```

### 2. Core Modules Implementation

#### 2.1 Pose Extraction (MediaPipe Integration)

We implemented the `PoseExtractor` class that:
- Leverages MediaPipe for accurate pose estimation
- Processes cricket batting videos frame-by-frame
- Extracts 33 key body landmarks with 3D coordinates
- Saves processed data in structured JSON format
- Optionally creates visualization frames for debugging

#### 2.2 Biomechanical Feature Engineering

We developed the `JointAngleCalculator` class that:
- Calculates critical joint angles for cricket batting technique:
  - Elbow angles (shoulder-elbow-wrist)
  - Knee angles (hip-knee-ankle)
  - Shoulder angles (torso-shoulder-elbow)
- Computes dynamic features (velocities and accelerations)
- Normalizes and processes the data for neural network input
- Implements smoothing for noisy pose data

#### 2.3 LSTM Neural Network Architecture

We designed the `StraightDriveLSTM` model that:
- Uses bidirectional LSTM layers to capture temporal dependencies
- Processes sequences of biomechanical features
- Classifies correct vs. incorrect technique execution
- Includes dropout for regularization
- Provides confidence scores for predictions

#### 2.4 Visualization and Feedback System

We created the `PoseVisualizer` class that:
- Renders skeletal overlays on original video frames
- Creates time series plots of joint angles
- Color-codes joints based on technique correctness
- Adds instructional text annotations to highlight issues
- Generates comprehensive technique reports with recommendations

#### 2.5 End-to-End Analysis Pipeline

We developed the `CricketTechniqueAnalyzer` class that:
- Orchestrates the complete analysis workflow
- Segments cricket shots into phases (backlift, downswing, impact, follow-through)
- Integrates pose extraction, feature calculation, and classification
- Produces detailed analysis results and visualizations
- Handles both single video and batch processing

### 3. Configuration System

We implemented a flexible YAML-based configuration system that allows:
- Easy parameter adjustment without code changes
- Configuration of pose estimation settings
- Customization of model architecture parameters
- Control over visualization styles and outputs

### 4. Documentation and Examples

We provided:
- Comprehensive docstrings for all modules and functions
- A detailed README with installation and usage instructions
- A demonstration Jupyter notebook showing the workflow
- Configuration examples for different use cases
- Sample test cases to ensure component integration

## Technical Highlights

1. **Modular Design**: Each component has clear responsibilities and interfaces, allowing for easy replacement or enhancement.

2. **Extensibility**: The system is designed to accommodate future enhancements, such as additional feature engineering or more sophisticated models.

3. **Configurability**: Parameters are externalized in YAML files, making it easy to adjust the system without code changes.

4. **Separation of Concerns**: Data processing, feature engineering, modeling, and visualization are cleanly separated.

5. **Pipeline Architecture**: The system flows naturally from raw video to actionable feedback through discrete, testable stages.

## Next Steps (Sprint 2 Preview)

In the upcoming sprint, we plan to:

1. **Data Collection and Labeling**:
   - Record and label a dataset of correct and incorrect straight drives
   - Create annotations for different technique issues

2. **Model Training and Validation**:
   - Train the LSTM model on the labeled dataset
   - Implement cross-validation and performance metrics
   - Fine-tune hyperparameters for optimal performance

3. **Enhanced Feedback**:
   - Develop more specific technique correction suggestions
   - Create comparative visualizations (player vs. ideal technique)

4. **Real-time Analysis**:
   - Implement streaming video analysis for live feedback
   - Optimize the pipeline for lower latency

## Conclusion

Sprint 1 has successfully established the foundational architecture and core functionality of the cricket biomechanics analysis system. The modular design provides a solid base for future development, and the implemented components demonstrate the feasibility of our approach. With this foundation in place, we are well-positioned to proceed with data collection, model training, and enhanced feedback mechanisms in Sprint 2.
