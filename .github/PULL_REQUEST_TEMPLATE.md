# Sprint 1 Review: Biomechanical Neural Network Analysis of the Straight Drive in Cricket

## Sprint Goal
To establish the foundational architecture and core modules for the cricket biomechanics analysis system.

## Completed User Stories
- [x] Set up project structure and directory organization
- [x] Implement pose extraction module using MediaPipe
- [x] Create joint angle calculation and feature engineering components
- [x] Develop LSTM model architecture for technique classification
- [x] Build visualization tools for pose data and joint angles
- [x] Create inference pipeline for end-to-end analysis
- [x] Add demo notebook showing the system workflow

## Key Components Implemented
1. **Data Collection**: `PoseExtractor` class for extracting body landmarks from videos
2. **Feature Engineering**: `JointAngleCalculator` for biomechanical measurements
3. **Model Architecture**: `StraightDriveLSTM` for sequence-based technique classification
4. **Visualization**: `PoseVisualizer` for creating visual feedback
5. **Inference Pipeline**: `CricketTechniqueAnalyzer` for end-to-end analysis

## Technical Highlights
- Modular design allowing for flexible component replacement or enhancement
- Comprehensive configuration system via YAML files
- Clear separation of concerns between data, features, model, and visualization
- Focus on extensibility for future sprint developments

## Testing and Documentation
- Included detailed docstrings for all modules and methods
- Created demonstration notebook to showcase the workflow
- Added configuration examples and parameter documentation

## Future Work (Next Sprint)
- Data collection and labeling of actual cricket batting videos
- Training and validation of the LSTM model
- Real-time analysis capabilities
- Enhanced feedback mechanisms with specific technique corrections

## Screenshots/Demo
[Add screenshots or video demo if available]

## Additional Notes
This sprint focused on establishing the foundational architecture. The next sprint will focus on data collection, model training, and enhancing the feedback system.
