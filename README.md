# Biomechanical Neural Network Analysis of Cricket Shots

## Project Overview
This project develops a biomechanics analysis system using neural networks to evaluate cricket shots. The system uses pose estimation and deep learning to classify technique, identify key movement phases, and provide corrective feedback to athletes and coaches.

## Key Features
- **Pose Tracking**: Captures a player's joint positions using pose estimation models
- **Movement Analysis**: Extracts kinematic features such as joint angles and bat trajectory
- **Neural Network Classifier**: Uses LSTM-based deep learning to recognize proper vs. improper execution
- **Technique Scoring**: Assigns performance scores and flags biomechanical inefficiencies
- **Real-time Feedback**: Provides actionable coaching cues
- **Multiclass Shot Classification**: Identifies different cricket shot types from static images

## Usage

### Video Analysis System
For analyzing cricket shots from video sequences, see the Jupyter notebook demos:
```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/01_cricket_biomechanics_demo.ipynb
```

### Image Classification System
For classifying cricket shots from static images:

```bash
# Train the classifier
python src/train_image_classifier.py --extract_poses --visualize

# Predict on new images
python src/predict_cricket_shot.py --model models/cricket_shot_classifier.pt --input path/to/image.jpg --visualize
```

For detailed instructions on the image classification system, see [README_IMAGE_CLASSIFIER.md](README_IMAGE_CLASSIFIER.md).
