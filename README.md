# Biomechanical Neural Network Analysis of the Straight Drive in Cricket

## Project Overview
This project develops a biomechanics analysis system using neural networks to evaluate cricket straight drives. The system uses pose estimation and deep learning to classify technique, identify key movement phases, and provide corrective feedback to athletes and coaches.

## Key Features
- **Pose Tracking**: Captures a player's joint positions using pose estimation models
- **Movement Analysis**: Extracts kinematic features such as joint angles and bat trajectory
- **Neural Network Classifier**: Uses LSTM-based deep learning to recognize proper vs. improper execution
- **Technique Scoring**: Assigns performance scores and flags biomechanical inefficiencies
- **Real-time Feedback**: Provides actionable coaching cues
